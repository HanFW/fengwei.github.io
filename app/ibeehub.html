	    			<p>To learn how to improve UX, I attended this UX summer course at Peking University last summer. As I happened to know that the company I previously interned in had a new project idea of creating a portfolio management platform, I volunteered to design this system for them both as their project proposal and as my individual assingment for the summer course. I would like to thank the company here for giving me such a great opportunity and thank all the amazing colleagues I had during my internship, who also helped a lot with the usability test of this project. </p>

            	<p>
            		I recruited four business analysts under the Business Development department at iBeeHub as testers. These business analysts were very familiar with both startups and investors because they themselves serve as the bridge between these two groups of people. They also had regular contact with some local governments in terms of entrepreneurship events. Moreover, they can also be considered as overseas talents. Considering all these factors and my limited time, they were the most suitable testers at that time because they were familiar with all four groups of users. 
            	</p>
            	<h6>Facilities</h6>
            	<p>
            		Computers & Skype. Since I was already back to China when I did this project, the usability test had to be done remotely via Skype. Video calling and screen sharing were used for me to listen to their immediate feedback and observe the user behaviours while they are performing the tasks. 
            	</p>
            	<h6>Script</h6>
            	<p>
            		• Opening: Introduce the four main users of the website and the tasks. Encourage the tester to provide their own opinions and feedback while performing the tasks. <br>
            		• Task 1: Play the role of a Startup Founder to: create new profile, login, view investors list, view investor profile, view governments list, view government profile, edit startup profile, logout. <br>
            		• Task 2: Play the role of an Investor to: create new profile, login, view startups list, view startup profile, edit investor profile, logout. <br>
            		• Task 3: Play the role of an Overseas Talent to: create new profile, login, view governments list, view government profile, edit personal profile, logout. <br>
            		• Task 4: Play the role of a Local Government to: create new profile, login, view talents list, view talent profile, view startups list, view startup profile, edit government profile, logout. <br>
            		• Ending: ask the tester to finish the System Usability Scale questionnaire.

                                    Developed in the early nineties by Wharton, it is a task-specific usability inspection method used to identify usability issues in interactive systems, focusing on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system.

                                    Introduced in the usability field by Clayton Lewis, it involves participants thinking aloud as they are performing a set of specified tasks. Participants are asked to say whatever comes into their mind as they complete the task.
