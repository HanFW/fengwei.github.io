                    <p>I first worked on this project when I was in Stockholm, Sweden for my university exchange program. In a two-day entrepreneurship hackathon, five of us in the team brainstormed solutions to address the safety issues of European countries. After my exchange program, I brought the idea back to the Interaction Design course in my university. In two months’ time, we managed to follow the design thinking process and applied the user-centered design approach, in order to create a product that would have real benefits for the travelers.</p>

                <p>
                    Based on our previous user study and the definition of our personas, we concluded that our users would have the following problems/needs: <br><br>
                    1. Research on general safety information of destinations are time-consuming because of: <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • Lack of integrated results - information scattered in different websites<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • Lack of information about real experiences from others - users need to ask around or browse through a few blogs, forums<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • No effective filtering of results<br>
                    2. Safety tips: many users spend much time to do a lot of research about general safety tips before travelling<br>
                    3. Users would want to reach help quickly when they encounter issues/emergencies during the trip

                <p>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • Safety rating should be obvious enough for the users<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • Using icons only can be confusing<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • Although the “travel mode” confuses users at the beginning, they find it very useful after knowing how it works<br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp • Users would “agree with” other’s past experiences or “find it helpful” but won’t “like” it

                <p>We know this is not the end. We are glad that our product was highly appreciated by the users and indeed solves many pain points for travellers. However, we are also aware that the product can still be further improved to enable a better user experience. For example, finding the balance between simplicity and details is always an art that requires rounds of usability tests with the target users, and also contextual inquiry, to better understand how the app will be used in the real world. To keep improving the product, we believe that the most important is to adopt a human-centered approach and always put the users at the bottom of our heart. </p>
