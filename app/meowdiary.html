	    			<p>To learn how to improve UX, I attended this UX summer course at Peking University last summer. This assignment was done in a team of 10 as our group assignment of the course. After rounds of discussions about all the brilliant ideas from each individual of the team, we decided to put our focus on the rapidly increasing population of cat addicts in China in 2017. We had a great cross-disciplinary team to work on different parts of this project: some teammates majoring in psychology designed and conducted initial user study survey, other students who major in design came up with the prototype, and I was mainly in charge of consolidating and analyzing the prototype evaluation results. <p>

            	<p>After the initial brainstorming session, we designed questions and conducted online surveys to learn about users’ problems and needs. We separated our potential users into two segments - cat owners and the others, especially cat lovers who do not raise cats for various reasons. Besides basic questions about gender, age group and occupation, we had questions focusing on studying the current problems of cat owners, and other cat lover’s interests as well as their opinions about cat adoption. There were 140 respondents in total, consisting of 41 male and 99 female. </p><br>

            				Suggestion: Since this is one of the most useful functions to cat owners and is also profitable, we can consider putting it on the cat owners' main page.
